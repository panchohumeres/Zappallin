## Docker multi-container environment with Hadoop, Spark, Hive and Jupyter Notebooks, with PySpark and Scala support.
### Intended to be a lighter alternative to Apache Zeppelin
### Forked from: https://github.com/Marcel-Jan/docker-hadoop-spark

![Stack Architecture](Zapallin.png)

This is it: a Docker multi-container environment with Hadoop (HDFS), Spark and Hive. But without the large memory requirements of a Cloudera sandbox. (On a Windows 10 laptop (with WSL2) it seems to consume a mere 3 GB.)
It includes a Jupyter Notebook container, with PySpark 3.0, Open JDK 4.0 and Scala Kernel (from Jupyter official docker stacks), which allows communication with Spark cluster through Jupyter's interactive IDE. It's like a light alternative of Apache Zeppelin!

The only thing lacking, is that Hive server doesn't start automatically. To be added when I understand how to do that in docker-compose.


## Quick Start

To deploy an the HDFS-Spark-Hive cluster, run:
```
  docker-compose up
```

`docker-compose` creates a docker network that can be found by running `docker network list`, e.g. `docker-hadoop-spark-hive_default`.

Run `docker network inspect` on the network (e.g. `docker-hadoop-spark-hive_default`) to find the IP the hadoop interfaces are published on. Access these interfaces with the following URLs:

* Namenode: http://<dockerhadoop_IP_address>:9870/dfshealth.html#tab-overview
* History server: http://<dockerhadoop_IP_address>:8188/applicationhistory
* Datanode: http://<dockerhadoop_IP_address>:9864/
* Nodemanager: http://<dockerhadoop_IP_address>:8042/node
* Resource manager: http://<dockerhadoop_IP_address>:8088/
* Spark master: http://<dockerhadoop_IP_address>:8080/
* Spark worker: http://<dockerhadoop_IP_address>:8081/
* Hive: http://<dockerhadoop_IP_address>:10000

## Important note regarding Docker Desktop
Since Docker Desktop turned “Expose daemon on tcp://localhost:2375 without TLS” off by default there have been all kinds of connection problems running the complete docker-compose. Turning this option on again (Settings > General > Expose daemon on tcp://localhost:2375 without TLS) makes it all work. I’m still looking for a more secure solution to this.


## Quick Start HDFS

Copy breweries.csv to the namenode.
```
  docker cp breweries.csv namenode:breweries.csv
```

Go to the bash shell on the namenode with that same Container ID of the namenode.
```
  docker exec -it namenode bash
```


Create a HDFS directory /data//openbeer/breweries.

```
  hdfs dfs -mkdir -p /data/openbeer/breweries
```

Copy breweries.csv to HDFS:
```
  hdfs dfs -put breweries.csv /data/openbeer/breweries/breweries.csv
```


## Quick Start Spark (PySpark)

Go to http://<dockerhadoop_IP_address>:8080 or http://localhost:8080/ on your Docker host (laptop) to see the status of the Spark master.

Go to the command line of the Spark master and start PySpark.
```
  docker exec -it spark-master bash

  /spark/bin/pyspark --master spark://spark-master:7077
```

Load breweries.csv from HDFS.
```
  brewfile = spark.read.csv("hdfs://namenode:9000/data/openbeer/breweries/breweries.csv")
  
  brewfile.show()

## Quick Start Spark (Scala)

Go to http://<dockerhadoop_IP_address>:8080 or http://localhost:8080/ on your Docker host (laptop) to see the status of the Spark master.

Go to the command line of the Spark master and start spark-shell.
```
  docker exec -it spark-master bash
  
  spark/bin/spark-shell --master spark://spark-master:7077
```

Load breweries.csv from HDFS.
```
  val df = spark.read.csv("hdfs://namenode:9000/data/openbeer/breweries/breweries.csv")
  
  df.show()

How cool is that? Your own Spark cluster to play with.


## Quick Start Hive

Go to the command line of the Hive server and start hiveserver2

```
  docker exec -it hive-server bash

  hiveserver2
```

Maybe a little check that something is listening on port 10000 now
```
  netstat -anp | grep 10000
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:10000           0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      446/java

```

Okay. Beeline is the command line interface with Hive. Let's connect to hiveserver2 now.

```
  beeline -u jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000 -n root
  
  !connect jdbc:hive2://127.0.0.1:10000 scott tiger
```

Didn't expect to encounter scott/tiger again after my Oracle days. But there you have it. Definitely not a good idea to keep that user on production.

Not a lot of databases here yet.
```
  show databases;
  
+----------------+
| database_name  |
+----------------+
| default        |
+----------------+
1 row selected (0.335 seconds)
```

Let's change that.

```
  create database openbeer;
  use openbeer;
```

And let's create a table.

```
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS breweries(
    NUM INT,
    NAME CHAR(100),
    CITY CHAR(100),
    STATE CHAR(100),
    ID INT )
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
STORED AS TEXTFILE
location '/data/openbeer/breweries';
```

And have a little select statement going.

```
  select name from breweries limit 10;
+----------------------------------------------------+
|                        name                        |
+----------------------------------------------------+
| name                                                                                                 |
| NorthGate Brewing                                                                                    |
| Against the Grain Brewery                                                                            |
| Jack's Abby Craft Lagers                                                                             |
| Mike Hess Brewing Company                                                                            |
| Fort Point Beer Company                                                                              |
| COAST Brewing Company                                                                                |
| Great Divide Brewing Company                                                                         |
| Tapistry Brewing                                                                                     |
| Big Lake Brewing                                                                                     |

```

There you go: your private Hive server to play with.


## Configure Environment Variables

The configuration parameters can be specified in the hadoop.env file or as environmental variables for specific services (e.g. namenode, datanode etc.):
```
  CORE_CONF_fs_defaultFS=hdfs://namenode:8020
```

CORE_CONF corresponds to core-site.xml. fs_defaultFS=hdfs://namenode:8020 will be transformed into:
```
  <property><name>fs.defaultFS</name><value>hdfs://namenode:8020</value></property>
```
To define dash inside a configuration parameter, use triple underscore, such as YARN_CONF_yarn_log___aggregation___enable=true (yarn-site.xml):
```
  <property><name>yarn.log-aggregation-enable</name><value>true</value></property>
```

The available configurations are:
* /etc/hadoop/core-site.xml CORE_CONF
* /etc/hadoop/hdfs-site.xml HDFS_CONF
* /etc/hadoop/yarn-site.xml YARN_CONF
* /etc/hadoop/httpfs-site.xml HTTPFS_CONF
* /etc/hadoop/kms-site.xml KMS_CONF
* /etc/hadoop/mapred-site.xml  MAPRED_CONF

If you need to extend some other configuration file, refer to base/entrypoint.sh bash script.

## TROUBLESHOOTING:
* **Jupyter Notebooks**:
   - `Permission denied: <filename>` when creating files or folders on Jupyter Notebook endpoint:
      * **Cause**: Permission problems with mounted volumes. Jupyter container has by default a "jovyan" user, which Linux id is 1000. The container will only recognize as "writable" files and folders that in **the host** belong to the same Linux id==1000 (independent of the name of user and group).
      * **Diagnostic**:
         1. `docker-compose exec jupyter bash`.
         2. `id`------>This will list the jovyan user properties, including its Linux ID.
         3. `cd` into any of the mounted folders, then `ls -all`, check the folders and files owners and groups, if they do not belong to UID==1000, then there will be trouble.
         4. `exit` and `cd` into any of the mounted folders in the **host**, check who really owns the folders or files.
      * **Solution**, either:
         - **Copy permissions from a folder that works**
            * `sudo chmod -R --reference=<source_folder> <target_folder>`
            * `sudo chown -R --reference=<source_folder> <target_folder>`
         - **Change the owner of the folders to UID==1000**
            * `sudo chmod -R g+rwx <target_folder>`
            * `sudo chgrp -R 1000 <target_folder>`
            * `sudo chown -R 1000 <target_folder>`
      * **References**:
         - https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/issues/114
         - https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/what-is-with-the-weird-jovyan-user/1673
* **SSL Certificates**:
   - When ./certbot.sh cannot create certificates for endpoints, it might be due to filesystem permissions problems.
      * **Diagnostic**:
         1. cd into either `certbot` or `certificates` folders in `data` folder.
         2. Check permissions in folders : `ls -all`
         3. See if there are different patterns compared to other folders.
      * **Solution**, either:
         - **Copy permissions from a folder that works**
            * See jupyter solution
         - **Change the owner of the folders to UID==1000**
            * See jupyter solution.

* If Kibana container fails to start, due to Elasticsearch not ready yet (**"GREEN"** status in logs if it is ready), simply: `docker-compose up kibana` after cluster is ready.
